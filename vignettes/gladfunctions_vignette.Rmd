## List of functions in the package

* `GLAD_read`: Read in all the Qualtrics exported raw csv files in the specified path.

* `GLAD_sheet`: Read in the googlesheet dictionary sheet for a specified
  questionnaire. Note that the googlesheet must be read through this
  function and not by the `googlesheets4` package directly.

* `GLAD_clean`: Cleans all questionnaires or one specified questionnaire
  in 'dat_list' and creates exports.

* `GLAD_select`: Exports selected variables from a data set by specifying their names.

* `GLAD_derive`: Generates derived variables with names and formulae specified in the
GLAD dictionary

* `GLAD_getdescr`: Get Descripton (Title) for Selected Variables by specifying their names.

* `GLAD_plot`: Generates plots for the specified variable in the GLAD data.

* `GLAD_vartest`: Runs several variance tests (Levene's test, Fligner's test and Barlett's
test) for comparing variance across gender.

* `GLAD_missing`: Produces various summary statistics and plots for missingness
examination of a questionnaire.

* `GLAD_qplot`: Generates quantile plots for a specified variable in the GLAD data.

```{r setup}
library(gladfunctions)
devtools::load_all()
```

## Clean Qualtrics exports

* Specify the path to the directory containing the raw files exported
  directly from Qualtrics. This must contain the sign-up data and if an
  optional questionnaire is to be cleaned, the data of that optional
  questionnaire.

* We have a `python` script to prepare raw data files (export Qualtrics
  data and remove participant personal information). Please speak to Henry
  Rogers in the BioResource office.


### Raw data

```{r, raw path}
raw_path <- "../../../../Research/Data/GLAD/GLAD-Questionnaires-Cleaning/data_raw/"
```

* Read in data files as a list from `raw_path`

```{r read data, eval = FALSE}
dat_list <- GLAD_read(raw_path)
```

### Clean data

* Specify the path to export files to

```{r, clean path}
clean_path <- "../../../../Research/Data/GLAD/GLAD-Questionnaires-Cleaning/data_clean/"
```

* Clean all the questionnaire and export to `clean_path`

```{r clean all, eval = FALSE}
GLAD_clean("All", dat_list, clean_path)
```

Do not apply limits to continuous variables, so we could later examine the
effects of limits with plotting functions.

```{r clean keep limits, eval = FALSE}
GLAD_clean("All", dat_list, clean_path, limits = FALSE)
```

* Clean a specified questionnaire and export to `clean_path`

```{r clean specified questionnaire, eval = FALSE}
GLAD_clean("CIDID", dat_list, clean_path)
```

* Select variables to export with `Easy.name`

```{r select variables, eval = FALSE}
# Take the first element of the sheet list - `GLAD_sheet` is a vectorised
# function (vectorised functions take a vector and operate on all the items
# in a vector). This means that we can read in multiple sheets at once and
# store them in a list.

# We need to use [[1]] (with double square brackets) to extract the necessary data from an R list.
sheet <- GLAD_sheet("PAD")[[1]]
PAD <-
  readRDS(paste(clean_path, "rds_renamed/PAD_Renamed.rds", sep = "/"))

which <- c("pad.choking", "pad.chest_pain", "pad.nauseous", "pad.dizzy", "pad.hot_cold", "pad.numbness")
PAD_subset <- GLAD_select(PAD, which, sheet)
```

## Read in data file and dictionary sheet

* `rds` is a fast loading file format that preserves variable type
  information and can be read like a csv.

* I'm reading in the '_Renamed' version with `Easy.name`, but note that all
  the following should also work for the unrenamed version ( with
  `New.variable` names)

```{r read in data files}
PAD <-
  readRDS(paste(clean_path, "rds_renamed/PAD_Renamed.rds", sep = "/"))
sheet <- GLAD_sheet("PAD")[[1]]
```

## Add derived variables to data

Please check sheet 'PTSD' on the dictionary sheet for a simple example and "AGP" for a more complicated one.
Instructions are also available [here](https://github.com/lyh970817/GLAD-Questionnaires/blob/master/documents/instruction_dv.md).

```{r add derived variables, results = "markup"}
PTSD <- readRDS(paste(clean_path, "rds_renamed/PTSD_Renamed.rds", sep = "/"))
sheet2 <- GLAD_sheet("PTSD")[[1]]

AGP <- readRDS(paste(clean_path, "rds_renamed/AGP_Renamed.rds", sep = "/"))
sheet3 <- GLAD_sheet("AGP")[[1]]

PTSD_withderived <- GLAD_derive(PTSD, sheet2)
AGP_withderived <- GLAD_derive(AGP, sheet3)

# These are the last few columns we just added
tail(colnames(PTSD_withderived), 2)
tail(colnames(AGP_withderived), 4)
```

## Get variable descriptions

```{r get description, results = "markup"}
GLAD_getdescr(colnames(PAD)[5:8], sheet)
```

### Special feature: `as.numeric` factor variables

We normally are unable to recode factor variables as numeric variable.

Applying `as.numeric` to the R built-in class `factor` only returns its
internal integer representation.

```{r factor, results = "markup"}
unique(as.numeric(as.factor(PAD[["pad.anx_future_panic_attacks"]])))
```

However, the `lfactor` package preserves numeric values when recoding a
numeric variable to factor. Therefore, we can use this package to recode
our factor variables to numeric variables.

For example, for a `Binary` variable:

```{r lfactor, results = "markup"}
unique(as.numeric(PAD[["pad.anx_future_panic_attacks"]]))
```

Alternatively, you can use numeric copies of the factor variables. These
numeric copies have been copied from the raw data and put into the cleaned
data. These copy variables have the same names as the original variables
but with "_numeric" at the end.

```{r numeric factor, results = "markup"}
grep("numeric", colnames(PAD), value = T)
```

## Plots

* The `GLAD_plot` function returns plots for a specified variable,
  different plots are returned depending on the variable type, the
  information of which is provided through the `googlesheet` argument.

 ```{r sex plot, fig.width = 10}
# Use `fig.width` to avoid the figure being truncated.
GLAD_plot(data = PAD, var = "Sex", googlesheet = sheet)
```

```{r factor_plots, fig.width = 13}
GLAD_plot(
  data = PAD,
  var = "pad.anx_future_panic_attacks",
  googlesheet = sheet
)
```

* With variables of `Numeric/Continuous` type, multiple plot objects are
  returned in a named list.

* Note that for these variables, it is possible to supply a logical
  argument `include_outlier`. For variables that don't have maximum or
  minimum in the dictionary hence haven't been cleaned, this is useful for
  deciding cut-offs. When `include_outlier` is set to `TRUE`, it's also
  possible to specify your own limits for plots through the `limit` argument.

* Set `binwidth = "FD"` to apply the Freedman-Diaconis rule for deciding
  optimal binwidth. The default is '1' and should be suitable for most
  variables in the data sets.

```{r continuous_plots}
continuous_plots <- GLAD_plot(
  data = PAD,
  var = "pad.frequency_panic_attacks",
  googlesheet = sheet,
  include_outlier = FALSE,
  limits = c(1, 50),
  binwidth = "FD"
)
```

```{r continuous_plots_point}
continuous_plots$point
```

```{r continuous_plots_hist}
continuous_plots$hist
```

```{r continuous_plots_density}
continuous_plots$density
```

```{r continuous_densitybysex}
continuous_plots$densitybysex
```

* This plot is for categorical variables that allow multiple options to be
  selected.  Put in one of the variables representing the options.

* Don't seem to have a general way to extract the title from the
  dictionary. Specify the title for the plot yourself.

```{r categorical_plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
GLAD_plot(
  data = PAD,
  var = "pad.sweating",
  title = "PAD Screening",
  googlesheet = sheet
)
```

## Quantile plot

```{r vartest, results = "markup"}
GLAD_qplot(data = PAD, var = "pad.frequency_panic_attacks", googlesheet = sheet)
```

## Variance tests by sex

These tests allow us to explore whether variances differ across sex.

```{r, results = "markup"}
GLAD_vartest(data = PAD, var = "pad.frequency_panic_attacks")
```

For quantile plot and variance test, I also have a version that extracts
all the continuous variables and loops through them.  Would that be more
desirable?

## Missingness

* The `GLAD_missng` function returns a named list of various missingness summaries and plots.

```{r missingness}
missingness <- GLAD_missing(data = PAD)
 ```

* Percentage of participants with no variable missing.

```{r missingness percent, results = "markup"}
missingness$percent
 ```

```{r missingness descr}
missingness$descr
```

```{r missingness freq}
missingness$freq
```

The table below: a value of '1' indicates the percentage of participants
missing for the corresponding variable.

```{r missingness table}
print(missingness$table)
```

```{r missingness plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 10}
missingness$plot
```
